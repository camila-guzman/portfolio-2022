              <p> I created a website for a fake bakery inspired by my love for baked goods. I used PHP and SASS to create dynamic and efficient web pages with fully custom styles.</p>

              <p>I used MySQL to organize a database with two tables: one for account information with encrypted passwords and a second table for menu items and their details.</p>

              <p>This project will be redesigned and developed in March 2022 to showcase my growth.</p>

        <p>TrunkSide is a curbside food app concept. I worked as the Lead Designer responsible for strategizing the UX/UI design for the first front-end demo of TrunkSide during Knight Hacks, University of Central Florida's 36 Hour Hackathon. </p>
            
        <p> I designed prototypes for three screens using Figma. This Hackathon was the first time I had used Figma on a large scale project. </p>
            
        <p>I also pair programmed with two of my teammates as an observer, allowing me to use my knowledge of React and CSS to learn the basics of Flutter and lead the UI/UX strategy.</p>
            
        <p>I will continue working with the team as Lead Designer as the project grows. </p>

          <p>This is a web page concept created for the University of Central Florida's Historical Buildings Tour. My design centered on making the archives page more friendly for researchers <i>and</i> casual visitors alike.</p>
            
          <p> The mock-up includes eight pages. All eight pages were built with HTML, CSS, and UCF's front-end framework based on Bootstrap called 'Athena'. </p>
            
          <p>I created Adobe XD prototypes to plan out the layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens to ensure a cohesive design between devices.</p>
