    <p>My name is Camila Guzman and I am a developer and designer.</p>
      
    <p>
    I'm currently a senior at the University of Central Florida, graduating in May 2022. I work at UCF's Design Group as a web designer where I focus on designing and building responsive user experiences and interactions for the university community.</p>

    <p>
    I am a curious and creative learner! I'm always looking at existing websites to see what improvements can be made or look for subtle details that make a huge difference in how you navigate a page. I'm very interested in information architecture and how much it can affect a websiteâ€™s intuitiveness. </p>

<p>
When I am not working on web development or user experience projects, I love to learn foreign languages, paint, practice textile arts like knitting and crocheting, and listen to music.These mediums help me stay creative and inspire me to try building out new ideas designs and interactions in web spaces. </p>

<p>
I value community-oriented spaces that allow people to get together and share ideas, processes, and techniques. Working together on web projects is really satisfying for me because I love the exchange of tips and perspectives. </p>
